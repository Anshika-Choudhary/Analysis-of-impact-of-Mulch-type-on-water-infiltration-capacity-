This project aims to run an analysis on an experiment which investigates  the effects of different nitrogen levels and mulch type  on soil properties (water infiltration ,soil moisture etc.) and crop performance in a subtropical climate on Ishigaki Island. . Water infiltration is a critical process in soil hydrology, influencing soil moisture content, groundwater recharge, and nutrient transport. By understanding how mulch type and nitrogen levels affect water infiltration, we can enhance agricultural practices, soil conservation efforts, and water management strategies.

Questions
1.What is the impact of nitrogen levels on soil nutrient content and soil health indicators?
2.What are the effects of Mulch type on soil nutrient content and soil health indicators?
3.How do different combinations of nitrogen levels and Mulch type affect soil properties?
4.How does the incorporation of corn residue impact soil health and subsequent crop performance?
