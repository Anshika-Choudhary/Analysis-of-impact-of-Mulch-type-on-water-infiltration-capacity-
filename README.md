This project aims to run an analysis on an experiment which investigates the effects of two crucial factors, mulch type and nitrogen level, on the water infiltration capacity of soil. Water infiltration is a critical process in soil hydrology, influencing soil moisture content, groundwater recharge, and nutrient transport. By understanding how mulch type and nitrogen levels affect water infiltration, we can enhance agricultural practices, soil conservation efforts, and water management strategies.
